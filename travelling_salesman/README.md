### Travelling Salesman Problem

The proverbial seller visits $N$ (assuming here 20 by default) cities with given positions $(x_i, y_i)$, returning finally the city of origin. Each city is to be visited only once, and the route is to be made as short as possible.

The problem is solved with ants colony optimisation and simulated annealing technique
